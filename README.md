Just a test repository
With key facts about github

Repositories - a place to store and organize project files. 
  -> can contain folders, images, videos, spreadsheets and datasets.
  -> should include a README.md file to explain what's inside

Branch - a version of a repository. By default you have a master branch within the repository. You can
        make copies of this branch and work on it separately.
  -> allows you to work on different versions of the project simultaneously.

Commit - saved changes to a branch or file within a branch.
